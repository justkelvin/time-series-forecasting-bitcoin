        "# **Introduction:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Bitcoin was invented in 2009 by an anonymous person/group under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It is a form of crypto-currency which revolutionized the way we think about money. It is a decentralized digital currency with no central bank, can be sent from user-to-user and verified by peers as it involves a public ledger. Bitcoins price started soaring from 2017 and have been high since then. By the emergence of BTC in the year 2009 with the initial value of around one dollar, no one predicted that in 8 years it would pass all previous records and would reach to the unbelievable value of $18000. BTC presents an impressive proof to this as it is a time series prediction problem in a market still in its transient stage. As a result, it is highly unpredictable in the market [4], and this provides an opportunity in terms of prediction for time-series prediction models. A time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values. Models for time series data can have many forms and represent different stochastic processes. When modelling variations in the level of a process, three broad classes of practical importance are the autoregressive (AR) models, the integrated (I) models, and the moving average (MA) models. These three classes depend linearly on previous data points. Thus in this paper, we have focused mainly on the combinations like ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMAX (seasonal ARIMA exogenous) using RMSE as the evaluation metric for different models.\n",

        "Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have gained significant attention in recent years. The volatile nature of cryptocurrency prices poses a challenge for investors and traders who aim to predict future price movements accurately. In this project, we aim to apply time series analysis and forecasting techniques to predict the price of Bitcoin crypto. By addressing this research question, we aim to provide insights into the potential future trends of Bitcoin prices, aiding investors and market participants in their decision-making processes."

Statistical Analysis: We will apply various time series analysis techniques, including trend analysis, seasonality decomposition, and autocorrelation analysis, to explore the patterns and dynamics within the Bitcoin price data.

These visualizations will provide insights into the historical price trends, seasonality, and forecasted price movements."
